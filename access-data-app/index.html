    `routes.html` configures more-routing, and specifies all of the named routes
    used by this application. Take a look at it.

    Note that we are declaring these routes _outside_ of `<polyfora-app>` for a
    few reasons:

     * There can only be one `<more-route-config>` defined per page.

     * The `<polyfora-*>` elements refer to all the routes by name; so you could
       change the URLs of those routes without breaking the application.
